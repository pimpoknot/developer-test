2. **Document Your Journey**: Use the README of your repository to detail how you approached this test, the decisions you made, the structure and organization of your code, and most importantly, how to run your project. A backend developer from our team will be the first to run your project, so clarity in your instructions is paramount.

This is a technical test aiming to showcase your skills. There's no single "correct" way to complete it, but staying focused on the project's goals is key.

### Time Frame

There's no fixed deadline to submit this test, as we value the quality of the final product and the thought process behind it. However, we estimate that the challenge could take around 10-14 hours of coding.
